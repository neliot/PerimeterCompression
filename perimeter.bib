  abstract  = {This paper assumes a set of n mobile sensors that move in the Euclidean plane as a swarm. Our objectives are to explore a given geographic region by detecting and aggregating spatio-temporal events of interest and to store these events in the network until the user requests them. Such a setting finds applications in environments where the user (i.e., the sink) is infrequently within communication range from the field deployment. Our framework, coined SenseSwarm, dynamically partitions the sensing devices into perimeter and core nodes. Data acquisition is scheduled at the perimeter in order to minimize energy consumption while storage and replication takes place at the core nodes which are physically and logically shielded to threats and obstacles. To efficiently identify the perimeter of the swarm we devise the Perimeter Algorithm (PA), an efficient distributed algorithm with a message complexity of O(p + n), where p denotes the number of nodes on the perimeter and n the overall number of nodes. For storage and replication we devise a spatio-temporal in-network aggregation scheme based on minimum bounding rectangles and minimum bounding cuboids. Our trace-driven experimentation shows that our framework can offer significant energy reductions while maintaining high data availability rates.},

  abstract  = {Mobile robot/sensor networks have emerged as tools for environmental monitoring, search and rescue, exploration and mapping, evaluation of civil infrastructure, and military operations. These networks consist of many sensors each equipped with embedded processors, wireless communication, and motion capabilities. This paper describes a cooperative mobile robot network capable of detecting and tracking a perimeter defined by a certain substance (e.g., a chemical spill) in the environment. Specifically, the contributions of this paper are twofold: (i) a library of simple reactive motion control algorithms and (ii) a coordination mechanism for effectively carrying out perimeter-sensing missions. The decentralized nature of the methodology implemented could potentially allow the network to scale to many sensors and to reconfigure when adding/deleting sensors. Extensive simulation results and experiments verify the validity of the proposed cooperative control scheme.}
